                Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a
                heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there
                came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the
                lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its
                nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with
                fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse
                requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left
                it. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a
                net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it
                escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends.
                They lived happily in the forest afterwards.
